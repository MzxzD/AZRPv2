Then a screen appears where the user asks for a login or a registration.


There are two buttons: Login and Register that are in the middle of the screen. If you are already a user of this service, go to Login. If you run for the first time, then press the Register key. After clicking on the Register, a screen appears as in the following picture:

On this screen you will find the fields that you need to fill in so that you can register. In this example, we will register as SampleUser. Enter the desired username in the field where gray letters are written. In the gray letter box, type Password, type the password you want (the length of the password must be at least 6 symbols).


After you have entered your desired username and password, press Register. When you sign up successfully, the following screen opens. If there is an error, you will receive a description error as shown in the following illustration:

When successful registration, the application takes you to the following screen:


Here is a list of all your existing rooms (Rooms), since this is the first registration, it is necessary to create a new room. Pressing the "+" icon at the top right of the screen opens with a screen to create a new room.

When creating a room, you need to write the name of the room (located under Name), and add the people you want to communicate with. Under Paricipants, there is a textField that you fill in and when you add, the "balloon" of the selected user appears. If you want to add more users, continue writing (text input indicator). When you are satisfied with the one you want to create, you can press the Create button located at the top right corner. If you want to stop creating a room, then Cancel from the top left. By adding Create, a new room is created and returns to the main screen with a newly created room. If you cancel the Cancel, just go back to the main screen without a new room.

After the successful creation of the room you will see the first room on the screen of the room.



As can be seen from the picture, there is a room that was created and contains the name of the room, the name of the last person in the room (in this case, the person who created the room) and the time of the last message. When you click on that part, a chat screen opens.


In this screen you can see the keyboard and above the toolbar to send the message. Left to right: There is a button to add an image, add a location, a large blank area is the place where a text message is entered, while the arrow on the right shows the button to send the message. Typing on the keyboard fills the void with the text that is being input:

To send this message, just squeeze the arrow above the keyboard on the gray toolbar on the right. And then the message is sent and you get the following look:


As you can see, it immediately shows who sends and which message, and when it is sent. Let's see what happens when the other side responds:

a person named admin answered the message. And it seems he has also sent the site. Whenever someone sends a location, the icon will appear in the upper right corner of the text "balloon". Clicking on that button opens a new screen where the user is located.



In this screen, you can zoom in and out to see where the user is, when you are done, pressing the <sign in the upper left corner returns you back to the conversation.


admin has sent another message, with the picture! If you want to open an image, in the lower left corner of the textual "balloon" is the name of the image. By clicking on that name, I open a screen with you.



When you're done viewing a picture, pressing <sign in the upper left corner will bring you back to the conversation.
If you want to send an image, select the following button marked with a blue circle:

After that, the application asks for permission to access your pictures, you choose OK:

After selecting OK, select the image you want. When you have selected, Automatic returns to the admin chat and this time the image change icon indicates that the image is selected and ready to send

Just as with the location, if you want to send the location, just click the location button next to the image dub.

Of course, as with the image, you must allow the app to use your location. It's up to you when and if you like, but in our case we only use it when using the app. So, we choose Only While Using the App. And then the same icon changes the color by making it known that it is ready to send!

Now with all the fields filled, touch the Send button that is this arrow on the right side above the keyboard.

When you are finished typing, pressing the <sign in the upper left corner returns you back to the main message menu.
